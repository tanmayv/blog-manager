First, make peace with the fact that you need to learn more than just React to work with React. This is a good thing, React is a library that does one thing really well, but it’s not the answer to everything.
</p>
<p>
However, identify whether what you’re currently learning is React or not, mainly so that you don’t get confused about your effort to learn React itself. A programmer who is comfortable with HTML and one other programming language will be able to pick 100% of React in 1 day or less. A beginner programmer should be good enough with React in a about a week. This is not counting the tools and other libraries that complete React like for example, Redux or Relay.
</p>
<p>
There is an important question about the order with which you need to learn things. This order would vary based on what skills you have. It goes without saying that you need a solid understanding of JavaScript itself first, and of course, HTML as well. I like to be specific about this here, so if you don’t know how to map or reduce an array, or if you don’t understand the concept of closures and callbacks, or if seeing “this” in JavaScript code confuses you, you’re not ready for React and you still have a lot to do in JavaScript land.
</p>
<p>
Refreshing your knowledge on JavaScript first would not hurt, specially because you need to learn ES2015, not because React depends on it (it does not), but because it’s a much better language, and most of the examples, courses, and tutorials you’ll find use the modern JavaScript syntax. Specifically, you need to learn the following:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>The new features of the object literal and template strings</li>
    <li>Block scopes and let/const vs var</li>
    <li>Arrow functions</li>
    <li>Destructuring and default/rest/spread.</li>
    <li>Classes and inheritance (used slightly in defining component, but to be avoided otherwise)</li>
    <li>Imports and exports of modules (most important of all)</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<pre>
  <code class="jsx">
    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
    import App from './App.jsx';
    import './index.css';

    ReactDOM.render(
      <App />,
      document.getElementById('root')
    );
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  You don’t have to start with ES2015, but you do need to eventually learn it (and not because you’re learning React).
  So other than ES2015 stuff, you need to learn the following to be a productive React developer.
